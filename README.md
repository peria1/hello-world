# hello-world
Learning git at last. This had better be better than SVN!
I am feeling cranky about this. Why must we have so many different flavors of source control, and so many frameworks for deep learning, etc? ARGH! Why are there so many people who fetishize "cracking the code" rather than solving problems? 

Well, ok, I am back to learning git, or at least learning to use github. In the meantime I have learnned a lot of Python, and written code that builds an LMDB of tissue image tiles.
